# 100Doro (A Pomodoro for the 100Devs community)
Pomodoros can often feel like a solitary endeavor. We watch the slow tick of the timer, striving to stay focused and steadfast in our studies, just like St. Barbara taught us. But what if there was a better way? What if we leaned on our community to help us through the tough moments—the "trough of sorrow"—when motivation wanes?

With 100Doro, you’ll never walk alone, just like the fans at Anfield Stadium. 100Doro connects you with a supportive community, cheering you on as you tackle each Pomodoro. You’re not just studying alone; you’ve got a team behind you, pushing you forward!
